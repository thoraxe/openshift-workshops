## Lab: Automating Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline

### Background: CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment refer to a set of practises with
the intention of automating various aspects of delivery software. One of these
practises is Pipeline which is an automated process to define the steps a change
in code or configuration has to go through in order to reach upper environments
such as staging and production. OpenShift supports CI/CD Pipelines by integrating
the popular https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins pipelines] into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly within OpenShift.

### Exercise: Deploy Jenkins

OpenShift provides a certified Jenkins which includes a rich set of plugins that
enable the full pipeline flow. In the web console in your `explore{{USER_SUFFIX}}`
project, again click the *"Add to project"* button, and then find the `jenkins-ephemeral`
template, and click on it.

You can customize the Jenkins properties such as service name, admin password, memory
allocation, etc through the parameters in the web console. Specify _openshift3_ for
*Jenkins Password* and leave the rest of parameters with the default values. Click on
*Create* to deploy Jenkins.

OpenShift deploys a Jenkins pod and also creates a service and route for for the
deployed container.

Click on Jenkins route in order to open Jenkins Console. Login in Jenkins using the
admin credentials and explore the Jenkins Console.

NOTE: The admin credentials for Jenkins are: admin/openshift3

Jenkins uses the OpenShift REST API in order to integrate into various OpenShift
operations and therefore you should grant permission to the Jenkins service account
to invoke these APIs. Run the following CLI command to allow Jenkins to retrieve
information about state of OpenShift.

### Exercise: Pipeline Preparation

In a previous lab, you deployed the `nationalparks` application using the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)]
mechanism. S2I already provides build automation by automatically running builds
when source code changes, or an underlying image changes. Deployments are also automated
by S2I and can be triggered when the image they are based on changes. In this lab,
you will create a more complex workflow by creating a pipeline that extends the S2I
functionality by adding more steps to the build and deploy process. The following
diagram shows the pipeline you will create in this lab.

image::/images/pipeline-diagram.png[CI/CD Pipeline Diagram,800,align="center"]

There are two environments for the `nationalparks` application in this pipeline.
*Dev* container is the for development and test purposes where all code and
configuration changes are deployed so that you can run automated tests against it.
Furthermore, the test teams can run their manual tests on this container and
report any bugs discovered through their test cases. If the tests are all successful
and the _Deployment Manager_ in the team approves the change, it is then deployed to the
*Live* container which is the production environment with defined SLA and is
critical to function properly at all times.

The pipeline execution starts with a developer making a change in the application
code or configuration. For every change, the following steps are executed with the
goal of determining if the change is appropriate for deployment in the *Live*
environment:

. Clone the code from Git repo, build and run unit tests and build a docker image container the code (S2I)
. Deploy the docker image into *Dev* container
. Run automated tests against the *Dev* container
. Run manual tests against the *Dev* container
. Wait for the *Deployment Manager*'s to either approve or reject the deployment (e.g. manual tests have revealed an unacceptable number of bugs)
. If approved, deployed to the _Live_ container

You need to make a few modifications to the `nationalparks` application which is
deployed in previous labs in order to adjust it to the pipeline described above.
The deployment of the docker image is triggered automatically whenever a new
image is built by the S2I process. Since in this lab, the pipeline controls when the
deployments should take place, you need to remove the automated trigger from the deployment
configuration. Run the following CLI command to disable the deployment trigger.:

[source]
----
oc set triggers dc/nationalparks --remove-all
----

As discussed in previous labs, the `parksmap` web app queries the OpenShift API and
looks for services that have the label `type=parksmap-backend` and interrogates the
discovered endpoints to visualize their map data. After creating the pipeline,
`parksmap` should use the *Live* container instead of the *Dev* container so that
deployments to the *Dev* container does not disrupt the `parksmap` application.
You can do that by remove the `type` label from the *Dev* service so that the
`parksmap` web app uses only the *Live* service for the map data.

### Exercise: Create OpenShift Pipeline

The Pipeline is in fact a type of build that allows developers to define a Jenkins
pipeline for execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started,
monitored, and managed by OpenShift Container Platform in the same way as any other
build type. Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile, either embedded directly
in the build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the
build configuration.

In order to create the pipeline, as well as the *Live* container, run the following
CLI command:

[source]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-roadshow/nationalparks/master/ose3/pipeline.yaml
----

A new route, service and a pod is created for the *Live* environment as well as an
OpenShift Pipeline that automates the execution of steps showed in the above pipeline
diagram.

In order to trigger the pipeline, Go to *Builds* &rarr; *Pipelines* on the left
side-bar and click on *Start Pipeline* to start the exection of `nationalparks-pipeline`.
You can click on *View Log* to take a look at the build logs as they progress
through the pipeline or on *Build #N* to see the details of this specific pipeline
execution as well as the pipeline definition using the https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins DSL].

image::/images/pipeline-details.png[Pipeline Details]

When the pipeline reaches the *Deploy Dev* stage, a new deployment takes place to the *Dev* container
while leaving the *Live* container intact, not to disrupt the live environment.

NOTE: You will notice there are no containers in the *Live* environment. That is
because this is the first run of the pipeline and no deployments have taken place
yet so far in the pipeline in the *Live* container.

image::/images/pipeline-deploy-dev.png[Pipeline - Deploy to Dev]

Pipeline execution will pause after running automated tests against the *Dev*
container. Visit the `nationalparks` web service to query for data and verify the
service works as expected.

After the test stage, pipeline waits for manual approval in order to deploy to the
*Live* container.

image::/images/pipeline-input.png[Manual Approval]

Click on *Input Required* link which takes you to the Jenkins Console for approving
the deployment. This step typically will be integrated into your workflow process
(e.g. JIRA Service Desk and ServiceNow) and will be performed as part of the overall
deployment process without interacting directly with Jenkins. For simplicity in
this lab, click on *Proceed* button to approve the build.

image::/images/pipeline-jenkins-input.png[Jenkins Approval,1000,align=center]

Pipeline execution continues to promote and deploy the `nationalparks` docker image
which was successfully tested in the *Dev* container, to the *Live* container.

image::/images/pipeline-live-deployed.png[National Parks Live Container]

On *Builds* &rarr; *Pipelines*, click on *View History* to go to the pipeline overview
which shows the pipeline execution history as well as build time metrics so that you can
iteratively improve the build process as well detect build time anomalies which usually
signal a bad change in the code or configuration.

NOTE: Build metrics are generated and displayed after a few executions of the pipeline
to determine trends.

Congratulations! Now you have a CI/CD Pipeline for the `nationalparks` application.
